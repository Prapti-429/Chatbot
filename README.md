# Chatbot Project with Advanced Features
This project is a comprehensive chatbot system that includes multiple advanced features:

1. **Basic Chatbot with Hard-Coded Responses**
2. **Intelligent Responses Using Generative AI**
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
4. **LLM Orchestration Pattern**
5. **Multi-Language Support**
6. **User Authentication**
7. **Feedback Mechanism**

## Features

### 1. Basic Chatbot with Hard-Coded Responses

A simple chatbot that responds with pre-defined, hard-coded messages based on user input.

### 2. Intelligent Responses Using Generative AI

Enhanced with OpenAI's GPT model to generate intelligent and contextually relevant responses.

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Integrates RAG to provide responses based on a given knowledge base, improving accuracy and relevance.

### 4. LLM Orchestration Pattern

Utilizes an orchestration pattern with a router to direct queries to specific task-based models (e.g., factual, creative, sentiment analysis).

### 5. Multi-Language Support

Detects the language of user input and translates it to English if necessary, then responds in the original language.

### 6. User Authentication

Supports user registration and login to provide a personalized chat experience and manage user sessions.

### 7. Feedback Mechanism

Allows users to rate and provide feedback on chatbot responses, which is stored for analysis and improvement.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
